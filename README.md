# OK Coders Back-End Course

### Overview

Our goal is to learn programming for the server (i.e back-end programming). This
is a broad topic, so specifically we will learn how to gather, store, and serve
data. We will gather data by scraping a website, store it in a database, and
stand-up a restful api for others to consume the data we stored.

Technologies we will use throughout the course to do this:

javascript: [javascript?](https://www.javascript.com/), [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [eloquentjs](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
bash: [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [command line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)
[node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
[html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
[css](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
[git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

Frameworks we will probably use (frameworks move pretty fast, a new one might
come out that we may like more):

[lodash](https://lodash.com/)
[mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)
[express](http://expressjs.com/)
[request](https://github.com/request/request)
[cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)

### General tenets for the course:

  - Get comfortable with not knowing (and be honest about what you do not know)
  - Through knowing how to look things up, we gain our comfort in not knowing
  - Respect the space we are in and the people around you

### Communication

[Slack Channel](okcokcoders.slack.com)
Email: okcoders@gmail.com

### Expectations:

If you are an adult and are taking this course, I do not believe any high
school/college type tricks are needed (i.e grading homework, making up
class, etc.), as you are willfully doing this and are already putting in effort
because you want to. That being said, we do have a graduation showcase, and we
do give out certificates, and this is something you can put on your linkedin. If
want to be able to do any of these things, 80% attendance is required (i.e you
can miss 3 classes).

We will have homework, though I strongly suggest independent reading of the
materials I provide for each topic we cover. There will usually not be answers
for the homework (as there are a lot of ways to do things), but if you need
help, the mentors, myself, and the slack channel are available to you. Do not be
afraid to reach out!

### Sites we could scrape

[County Assessor](http://www.oklahomacounty.org/assessor/SearchMethod.htm)
[IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/), [someone already did what we will be doing](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
[Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/) (my favorite website)
[Oklahoma](https://www.ok.gov/)
[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/), because they removed their public api

### Site we wouldn't need to scrape

[Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation)
[Wikipedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)
[Github](https://api.github.com/)
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/api)
